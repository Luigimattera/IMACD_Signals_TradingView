Impulse MACD Trading Signals
This repository contains a trading strategy based on the Impulse MACD indicator, implemented in Pine Script for the TradingView platform. The strategy generates signals for buying and selling financial assets based on the crossover and crossunder of the Impulse MACD histogram and a far-from-zero band.

The strategy was inspired by the work of the author LazyBear and was adapted to include custom parameters such as the length of the moving averages and the far-from-zero band, which can be adjusted according to the user's preferences.

To use the strategy, simply copy the code from the imacd_strategy.txt file and paste it into the Pine Script editor in TradingView. Then, customize the parameters as desired and save the script. Finally, add the script to a chart of a financial asset and start receiving trading signals.

Please note that this strategy is provided for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Use it at your own risk and always perform your own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.
